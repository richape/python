# Python

Here I am playing around with and trying to learn python. This is something new for me but looks easy enough to grasp.
I prompted Chat GPT to write me some basic exercises to help me learn.

# Exercises

- plaindrome-checker
- fizzbuzz
- fibonacci-sequence

These exercises were hard to begin with but I feel like a good understanding of JS helps
